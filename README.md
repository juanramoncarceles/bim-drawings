# BIM Drawings

This web application will allow to review 2D documentation of a BIM project. The user will be able to consult the BIM information associated to the elements in the drawings, calculate distances, areas and angles and add comments. It is also possible to share a project and collaborate.

This app requires an exporter for each BIM platform from which it wants to obtain project data.   
Under development there is the one for Rhino and VisualARQ: https://github.com/juanramoncarceles/bim-drawings-visualarq-exporter
